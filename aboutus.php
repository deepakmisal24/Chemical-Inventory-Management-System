  <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>Deepak Misal</strong>, a final-year Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) student. This Inventory Management System is a part of my academic projects .</p>

  <p>The project focuses on simplifying and digitizing the process of managing chemical, glassware, and instrument inventories within laboratories or educational institutions. With features like dynamic record updates, deletions, transaction logging, and user authentication, it ensures accuracy and accountability in lab resource management.</p>

  <p>This system is built using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>XAMPP</strong>, and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, following standard web development practices. The goal is to create an efficient, user-friendly tool that can be easily adopted and extended for real-world applications in academic or research environments.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to reach out!</p>
